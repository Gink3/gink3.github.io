Just finished my summer class with a B. Learned a few things. Group projects are dumb when group mates simply do not care about their grade. Overall it was a miserable experience and I wish there were more options for the group sections of that class. On the other hand I am trying out for the UNT CSGO team. Its pretty fun overall. Too bad I'm not the best. Ive been learning a lot lately from from one of the current A team members. We have about a week or two until we find out teams.
