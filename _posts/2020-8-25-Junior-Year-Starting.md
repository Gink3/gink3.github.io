title: Junior Year Starting

---

Yesterday was the start of my junior year at UNT. With this new semester I am taking 16 hours with my last two non-stem related courses.

Currently I will be taking
* 2610 - Systems Programming
* 3600 - Assembly language and Computer Organization
* 3110 - Data Structures and Algorithms
* 4180 - Advanced Technical Communications
* 2700 - Linear Algebra and Vector Geometry

The last day and a half or so has been nothing but zoom malfunctions and covid safety briefs. This change has been tough on the faculty as now we are using blended classes with a majority being online via zoom. If I had known it would be this way I would have stayed home and just not dealt with the drive everyday. Oh well, I will learn to deal with it.

It used to be the fun and exciting to go to discovery park, I could chat with friends and see what they were working on, but now its like an office with no one talking and empty hallways. They mandate everything you do from where you sit and walk to how you enter and exit class rooms. Its crazy, like some sci fi movie came to life and took over school.
