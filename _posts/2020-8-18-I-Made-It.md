After weeks of tryouts for the UNT CSGO team the results are in. I am now the in game leader(igl) of the B team. I am thrilled to get to work in a leadership and planning role for the team. This could be a lot of fun and some great competitive experience. 


Anyways heres a run down of how the club is structured with the 3 different teams.
* Varsity
* Talons Green <-- My team
* Talons White

With any player able to move up or down a team if they show they are capable of the work in matches or practice. Each team is 5 people with an IGL and the ability to ask for help from our coach and analyst, Coley.


In the end I think this is gonna be lot of fun for me. I will be sure to continue updates as the year goes on with school projects and the CSGO team.
